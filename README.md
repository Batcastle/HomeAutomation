Home Automation program that works with Phillips Hue lights

## About
This program is designed to be quick an easy to set up on any Linux system using Python and SystemD. It will monitor for the configured IP addresses. When those IP addresses are up, and it is past configured times, the program will automatically turn on Phillips Hue Smart Lights. This is mostly for my personal use but I encourage others to fork and make modifications where necessary for their purposes.
